                    Celebrity social media wrangler by day, tired web development student by night! I know what you're
                    thinking, but I assure you, we do exist!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked in the social media space for over 13 years, paying many high-profile people millions
                    of dollars for posting sponsored social media ads that I write! The upside to that is the occasional
                    free product. The downside is ...well, there aren't all that many...but a change of pace,
                    environment and challenging new skillset are always welcomed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a serial learner. I love to learn. I am especially thrilled to learn any combination of things
                    that
                    pique my interest, such as: history, boardgames, food, The Simpsons, world religions, time travel,
                    fantasy and science fiction, or paranormal activities. Therefore, history of food? LOVE! Boardgames
                    about time travel- awesome! World Religion/Philosophy through the eyes of The Simpsons? That's what
                    I'm
                    talking about!
                </p>

                    You think I'd have a lot of time what with my social media job (yes, it's a real job), but actually,
                    I have two mini versions of myself: Genevieve and Juliette. We spend a lot of time at the local
                    library, planning our costumes for our yearly trip to Megacon and trying to recreate dishes from
                    baking shows. Lovely to meet you!
